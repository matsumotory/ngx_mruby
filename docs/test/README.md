ngx_mruby test uses mruby test.
ngx_mruby test is very earlier and experimental version. 

Welcome pull-request!
## Add test
##### Add location config to ``test/conf/nginx.conf``
```nginx
# Nginx.hello test
location /mruby {
    mruby_content_handler build/nginx/html/unified_hello.rb cache;
}
```
##### Add hook script into ``test/html/`` if you need the script for location config
```ruby
# test/htdocs/unified_hello.rb
if server_name == "NGINX"
  Server = Nginx
elsif server_name == "Apache"
  Server = Apache
end

Server::rputs "Hello #{Server::module_name}/#{Server::module_version} world!"
```
##### Add test code to ``test/t/ngx_mruby.rb``
```ruby
assert('ngx_mruby', 'location /mruby') do
  res = HttpRequest.new.get base + '/mruby'
  assert_equal 'Hello ngx_mruby/0.0.1 world!', res["body"]
end
```
## Testing
##### build nginx into ``./build/nginx`` and test on ``./build/nginx``
```
sh test.sh
```

If you want to run with valgrind, set the environment variables `NGINX_RUNNER` and `NGINX_HEATTIME`.

```console
$ NGINX_RUNNER=valgrind NGINX_HEATTIME=10 sh test.sh
```

## Running the tests under AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer

CI builds one matrix cell with `-fsanitize=address,undefined`. To run the
same build locally (Linux, gcc or clang):

```console
$ sudo sysctl -w vm.mmap_rnd_bits=28     # ASan and the kernel's high-entropy ASLR do not mix
$ export NGINX_EXTRA_CC_OPT="-fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer"
$ export NGINX_EXTRA_LD_OPT="-fsanitize=address,undefined"
$ export NGX_MRUBY_CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer"
$ export NGX_MRUBY_LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address,undefined"
$ export ASAN_OPTIONS="detect_leaks=1"
$ export LSAN_OPTIONS="suppressions=$PWD/test/lsan.supp"
$ export UBSAN_OPTIONS="print_stacktrace=1:suppressions=$PWD/test/ubsan.supp"
$ NGINX_RUNNER=exec sh test.sh
$ grep -E 'AddressSanitizer|UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer|runtime error|LeakSanitizer' build/nginx/logs/error.log
```

`NGINX_EXTRA_CC_OPT` and `NGINX_EXTRA_LD_OPT` are appended to nginx's
`--with-cc-opt` and `--with-ld-opt`; `NGX_MRUBY_CFLAGS` and `NGX_MRUBY_LDFLAGS`
reach the mruby build. Do not combine the sanitizers with valgrind. nginx
sends its stderr to `error.log` once the configuration is loaded, so reports
from code that runs while nginx parses the configuration (directive handlers,
script compilation, `mruby_init_code`) appear on the terminal instead; read
both. `test/ubsan.supp` lists the reports that come from nginx itself, each
with the reason. `test/lsan.supp` does the same for LeakSanitizer: nginx
never frees `cycle->connections` and the two event arrays it allocates in
`ngx_event_process_init`, and whether LeakSanitizer reports them at exit
depends on whether anything outside them still points at them, so without
the suppression a run can fail on nginx's own allocations. With the gcc 11
runtime that CI uses, a suppressed block hides nothing else; the LLVM
runtime and gcc 12 and later also treat a suppressed block as a root, so
there a block reachable only from those arrays is not reported either.
